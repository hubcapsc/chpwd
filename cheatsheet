I created an empty repository named chpwd at github by mashing the
"create a repository" button...

Then I cloned the empty project to my local host with:

  git clone git://github.com/hubcapsc/chpwd.git d.chpwd

Next I copied some files into my local repository and 
commited them to the local repository with:

  git add README
  git add chpwd.c
  git add .gitignore

  git commit

I probably should have said "https:" instead of "git:" when I did
the clone... anyhow, I had trouble pushing my local changes (master) 
back to the github repo (origin)... so I did this:

  git remote set-url origin https://hubcapsc@github.com/hubcapsc/chpwd.git

Then I was able to push my files up to github...

  git push origin master

I am editing this on branch_test_1 at github with the web interface

I am editing this on branch_test_1 on bleedingedge with vim
